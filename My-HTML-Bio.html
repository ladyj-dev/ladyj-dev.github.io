  <p>I am a passionately curious, eternally optimistic,  data visualization for good cheerleader! Where people see chaos I see patterns. To me a day that allows me to use data to tell a story that impacts someone's life for good is the best day.
      I am an avid bible reader and enjoy watching professional and college football. I aim to be 100% present wherever I am. A quote by Jane Austen describes me well "There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature."</p>
  <p>If I were a fabric I would be described as highly textured, with patterns that are woven instead of printed, with tiny tonal sequins for unexpected shine only when it hits the light along with playful, feminine details that are classy and comfortable.</p>
